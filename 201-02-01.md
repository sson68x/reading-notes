When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page
These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
- **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
- **Sementic markup**: provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.
