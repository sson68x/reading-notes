There are lots of occasions when we need to use list. HTML provides us with three different types.
- **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in thje list is numbered
  - The ordered list is created with the <**ol**> element.
- **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point.
  - The unordered list is created with the <**ul**> element.
- Each item in these lists are placed between an opening <**li**> tag and a closing <**/li**> tag.
- **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
  - Definition lists include <**dl**>, <**dt**>, and <**dd**>.
