# Document Object Model (DOM)
- The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the bowser window.

## Making A Model Of The HTML Page
- When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory.
- The DOM  specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tress.

## Accessing And Changing The HTML Page
- The DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.
- You will hear people call the DOM an **Application Programming Interface (API)**.
- User interfaces let humans interact with programs; APIs let programs talk to each other.


## The DOM Tree Is A Model Of A Web Page
- As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
- The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
- It consists of four main types of nodes.
  - The document node
  - Element node
  - Attribute nodes
  - Text nodes

## Working With The DOM Tree
- Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
  - 1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
  - 2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
