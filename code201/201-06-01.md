# Document Object Model (DOM)
- The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the bowser window.

## Making A Model Of The HTML Page
- When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory.
- The DOM  specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tress.

## Accessing And Changing The HTML Page
- The DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.
- You will hear people call the DOM an **Application Programming Interface (API)**.
- User interfaces let humans interact with programs; APIs let programs talk to each other.
