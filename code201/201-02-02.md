## Understanding CSS: Thinking inside the box
- The key to understading how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box is presented.

## CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
- CSS works by associating rule with HTML elements. There rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**.

## CSS properties affect how elements are displayed
- CSS declarations sit inside brackets and each is made up of two parts: a **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
