# Basic JavaScript Instructions
## STATEMENTS
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
- Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**.
- Statements should end with a semi-colon.

## COMMENTS
- You should write **cooments** to explain what your code does.
- They help make your code easier to read and understand.
- They help you and others who read your code.

## VARIABLES
- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job.
- It can store this data in **variables**.

## DATA TYPES
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values know as Booleans.

## ARRAYS
- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
