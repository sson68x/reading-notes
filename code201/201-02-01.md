When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page
These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
- **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
- **Sementic markup**: provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.

## HEADINGS
HTML has six **"levels"** of headings
- Ex. <**h1**>, <**h2**>, <**h3**>, <**h4**>, <**h5**>, and <**h6**>

<**h1**> is used for main headings
<**h2**> is used for subheadings
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <**h3**> element is used, and so on...

## PARAGRAPHS
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <**p**> tag and closing <**/p**> tag.

## BOLD & ITALIC
By enclosing words in the tags <**b**> and <**/b**>, we can make characters appear bold.
By enclosing words in the tags <**i**> and <**/i**>, we can make characters appear italic.

## SUPERSCRIPT & SUBSCRIPT
The <**sup**> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
The <**sub**> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.
