# Tables

## What's A Table?
- A table represents information in a grid format.
- Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sport results.
- Grid allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.
- Each block in the grid  is referred to as a **table cell**.
- In HTML, a table is written out row by row.

## Basic Table Structure
- The <**table** element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
- You indicate the start of each row using the opening <**tr**> tag.
- Each cell of a table is representd using a <**td**> element.
- The <**th**> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.
  
## Long Tables
- The headings of the table should sit inside the <**thead**> element.
- The body should sit inside the <**tbody**> element.
- The footer belongs inside the <**tfoot**> element.
