# What Is A Function?
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
- If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.

## Declaring A Function
- To create a function, you give it name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
- This is known as a **function declaration**.

## Calling A Function
- Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.
- Thins is known as **calling the function**.

## Declaring Functions That Need Information
- Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. 
- In such cases, when you declare the function you give it **parameters**.
- Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

## Calling Functions That Need Information
- When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name.
- The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as variables.

## Getting A Single Value Out Of A Function
- Some functions return information to the code that called them.
- For example, when they perform a calculationl, they return the result.

## Getting Multiple Values Out Of A Function
- Functions can return more than one value using an array.
- For example, the function calculates the area and volume of a box.

## What Is An Object?
- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world.
- In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

### IN AN OBJECT: VARIALBLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
- If a variable is part of an object, it is called a **property**.
- Properties tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.

### IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS
- If a function is part of an object, it is called a **method**.
- Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.

## Adding AND Removing Properties
- Once you have created an object, you can add new properties to it.
- You do this using the dot notation.
- Ex. hotel.gym = true; hotel.pool = false
- To delete a property, you use the keyword delete, and then use dot notation to identify the property or method you want to remove from the object.
- Ex. delete.hotel.booked

## This
- The keyword this is commonly used inside functiuons and objects.
- Where the function is declared alters what this means.
- It always refer to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.

## Arrays And Objects
- Arrays are actually  a special type of object. 
- They hold a related set of key and value pairs, but the key for each value is its index number.
- You can commbine arrays and objects to create complex data structures.
- Arrays can store a series of objects and remember their orders.
- Objects can also hold arrays as value of their properties.

## What Are Built-In Objects
- Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window.
- These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.
  - Browser Object Model
  - Document Object Model
  - Global JavaScript Objects
