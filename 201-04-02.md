# Key Concepts In Positioning Elements
## Building Blocks
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
- This box will either be a **block-level** box or and **inline** box.
## Containing Elements
- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the **containing** or **parent** element.
### Block-Level Elements
- start on a new line. Example include: <**h1**>, <**p**>, <**ul**>, <**li**>
### Inline Elements
- Flow in between surrounding text.  Example include: <**img**>, <**b**>, <**i**>

# Controlling The Position of Elements
- CSS has the following **positioning schemes** that allow you to control the layout of a page.
  - Normal flow
  - Relative positioning
  - Absolute positioning
- You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS.
- You can also float elements using the float property.
