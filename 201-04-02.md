# Key Concepts In Positioning Elements
## Building Blocks
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
- This box will either be a **block-level** box or and **inline** box.
## Containing Elements
- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the **containing** or **parent** element.
### Block-Level Elements
- start on a new line. Example include: <**h1**>, <**p**>, <**ul**>, <**li**>
### Inline Elements
- Flow in between surrounding text.  Example include: <**img**>, <**b**>, <**i**>

# Controlling The Position of Elements
- CSS has the following **positioning schemes** that allow you to control the layout of a page.
  - Normal flow
  - Relative positioning
  - Absolute positioning
- You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS.
- You can also float elements using the float property.

## Normal Flow
- In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
- Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be **position: static**.

## Realtive Flow
- Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
- Ex. You can move it 10 pixels lower that it would have been in normal flow or 20% to the right.

## Absolute Positioning
- When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
- The box offset properties specify where the element should appear in relation to its containing element.

## Fixed Positioning
- Fixed position is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
- It positions the element in relation to the browser window.
- Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place.
- It is a good idea to try this example in your browser to see the effect.
