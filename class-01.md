2. Your computer contacts a network of server called Domain Name System (DNS) server. Every device on the web has a unique IP address.
3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your cmoputer allows your browser to contact the web server that host the website you requested.
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
