# Color
## Foreground Color
- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
- You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways
  - RGB Values
  - Hex Codes
  - Color Names

## Background Color
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it apperars in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

## Understanding Color
- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.
- To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
  - RGB Values: values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
  - Hex Code: Hex values represent values for red, green and blue in hexadecimal code.
  - Color Names: colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in numbers.

## Contrast
- When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

## CSS3: HSL Colors
- CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
